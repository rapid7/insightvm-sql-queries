-- Data Warehouse
-- Presents the number of days to remediate asset vulnerabilities and whether or not they sit inside or outside a 30 day (modifiable) remediation SLA.Â  
-- This query only assumes remediation in that the vulnerability was no longer located on the asset and wrote the vulnerability no longer found out to the 'fact_asset_vulnerability_remediation_date' table
-- Copy the SQL query below
